# Gifos
The goal of this project is to build a front-end GIF website based on a UX design only using HTML, CSS and JS without any framework/librabry.

The site shows recommended and trending gifs (provided by the Giphy API).
Anyone can create their own gifs and upload them to Giphy once recorded. These will be then shown in the site. 
GIF search capability.
Two themes selection light/dark.
